    ADDRESSING THE DRUG USE PROBLEM IN INDIA: THE arrangements in India, different government departments and ministries
    work to address the problem of drug use. Like elsewhere in the world, three broad approaches are followed to address
    the issue of drug use – “supply reduction,” “demand reduction,” and “harm reduction.” The “supply reduction” sector
    of the government works toward reducing the availability of illicit drugs through implementing the relevant drug
    laws and policies and is managed largely by the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, the Narcotics Control
    Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India and a variety of other agencies in the central or state
    governments. The “demand reduction” sector, on the other hand, deals with reducing the demand for drugs in the
    population through prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
    (MoSJE), Government of India, is the nodal ministry for demand reduction and has a “Scheme for Prevention of
    Alcoholism and Substance (Drugs) Abuse” in place since 1985–86.[5] This scheme of the MoSJE is implemented by the
    nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), who run “Integrated Rehabilitation Centre for Addicts” for treatment and
    rehabilitation of people with SUD. The health sector of the country also plays a very important role in drug demand
    reduction by treatment of SUDs through government health-care facilities, which is the focus of this article. “Harm
    reduction” in India is primarily seen as prevention of HIV among people who inject drugs and various strategies for
    this are implemented by the National AIDS Control Organization, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).[6]Go
    to:THE “DRUG DE-ADDICTION PROGRAMME”: EVOLUTIONThe decade of 1980s witnessed some very important developments in
    India, in response to the rising problems of drugs use. Along with the scheme of MoSJE (mentioned earlier), there
    was a felt need among the experts and policy makers to address the medical treatment of SUDs through the health-care
    systems of the country, involving the MoHFW, Government of India. It was envisaged that treatment provision will be
    the mandate of MoHFW, while prevention and rehabilitación will be the mandate of the MoSJE. Following the
    recommendations of a Cabinet subcommittee, the “Drug De-addiction Programme (DDAP)” was launched in 1988. The
    program envisaged establishing 30-bedded “de-addiction centers” (DACs) (The term “de-addiction” continues to be used
    in the official communications of the Government health sector, and hence, it is being used here. It should not be
    seen as an endorsement of this term by the authors) in each of the six premier hospitals/institutions in the country
    for providing inpatient treatment for patients with SUD. Within next few years, the program was further expanded in
    1992–93 under a scheme for establishment of DACs in medical colleges/district hospitals in various states. Through a
    collaboration between the central and state governments, the one-time expenses for establishment of DACs were borne
    by the central government, while the recurring cost of running the DAC services was envisaged to be borne by the
    state governments. The arrangement between the central and state government was made taking into consideration that
    “health” subject is a shared mandate between the union and state governments under the Constitution of India. Thus,
    the central government assistance was largely limited to provision of one-time grant for infrastructure, while
    staff, supplies, and other recurring expenses were to be borne by the respective state governments. For the
    northeastern states, however, there was a provision of an additional recurring assistance of up to Rs. 200,000 per
    year per center by the central government. Under the scheme, about 122 DACs have been established by the MoHFW, of
    which 43 are in the northeastern states. Besides, the DACs in the northeastern states, few others were also
    supported by the MoHFW through provision of one-time infrastructure support as well as almost 100% of recurring
    expenses for staff and supplies. These were located in the following central government institutes: All India
    Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi; Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research,
    Chandigarh; National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru; Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate
    Medical Education and Research, Puducherry; and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi. Out of these, the DAC at
    AIIMS, New Delhi, was designated as the “National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre” (NDDTC) in 2002, with an
    expanded mandate of working as a national level resource center. Apart from the clinical, academic, and training
    activities, NDDTC has been tasked with the responsibility of playing an advisory role to the DDAP, MoH, and FW as
    well as coordination of several activities on behalf of the Ministry.[7,8]The “DDAP” is a modest-sized program
    coordinated by the MoHFW through a “section” in the Ministry where the day-to-day affairs are managed by a Director,
    DDAP, who in turn, reports to a Joint Secretary. In most of the state governments, there are no state-level
    counterparts for DDAP. There is also provision of an additional staff in the form of an assistant program
    officer/under-secretary. However, none of the senior administrative officials are responsible exclusively for this
    program and they have many other responsibilities as well. Thus, there is no senior official at the Union Health
    Ministry in Government of India, tasked exclusively with looking after the adicción treatment issues. The budget
    allocated to the DDAP is also modest; the approved budget outlay for 5 years in the 12th 5-year plan from 2012 to 17
    was Rupees one hundred and fifty-one crores.[9]Go to:MAJOR FOCUS AREA OF DRUG DE-ADDICTION PROGRAMME: Capacidad
    BUILDINGSince the direct provision of services through the MoHFW was very limited in scope and scale, an important
    area identified by the DDAP from its very inception was building the capacities of service providers for providing
    addiction treatment services. Considering the burden and magnitude of SUD and the shortage of specialist medical
    professionals (i.e., psychiatrists) in India, the strategy was t provide short-term, in-service training to the
    nonspecialist cadre of general duty medical officers (GDMOs), who were employed by the state government health
    services. Through national level workshops of experts in 1988 and 2003, training curricula were developed to train
    the GDMOs. While initially, the training courses were of three-week duration, over the years, the duration has been
    reduced to 14 days, 10 days, and then 7 days on receiving feedback from the training participants. NDDTC, along with
    other collaborating medical institutes, has conducted several training courses through which cumulatively more than
    1000 doctors have been trained in management of SUDs in general health-care settings.Some important experiences were
    gathered through these training programs. In general, these programs were perceived as very useful by the trainees.
    This is understandable, since at the level of graduate medical course (MBBS), there is hardly any exposure or
    training on substance use issues.[10] Thus, most trainees reported a significant enhancement of their knowledge,
    which has been corroborated objectively through comparison of their scores on the pre- and post-training tests.
    Another useful insight gained has been that the training programs are more effective when lecture/discussion formats
    are supplemented with clinical exposure through live case demonstrations and trainees joining the resource persons
    (faculty members) in the outpatient clinics or ward rounds. A major challenge has been in getting nominations of
    in-service doctors from their respective state governments for the training program due to their clinical
    responsibilities and competing health priorities. However, there is no clear indication whether the training gets
    translated in enhancement of service delivery at the hospitals.Along with medical professionals, efforts have been
    made to train paramedical and paraclinical professionals too though at a much smaller scale. Along with the
    development of training curricula and conducting training programs, a very important capacity-building initiative of
    DDAP has been development of resource materials such as manuals and handbooks for physicians, nurses, and
    paramedical staff on brief interventions, pharmacotherapy, and psychosocial interventions. Most of the resource
    materials are available for download free-of-cost from the NDDTC website at www.aiims.edu.Go to:DRUG ABUSE
    MONITORING SistemaYet, another demand reduction area in which the MoHFW has taken the lead is the establishment of
    “Drug Abuse Monitoring System” (DAMS) to track the pattern of drug use and profile of treatment seekers as well as
    to assess any change in trends among treatment seekers at the government DACs. This system, developed by NDDTC for
    DDAP, is based on data collection from all the government DACs on an annual basis and is continuing from the year
    2007 onward till date.[11] Data on clinical and demographic profile for all the “new” treatment seekers at each DAC
    are collected through a one-page performa and are collated and analyzed by NDDTC and shared with the DDAP. However,
    compliance of the DACs with this system is far from adequate; analysis of the DAMS data conducted from the year 2007
    to 2013 showed that 57% DACs participated in the activity; only 39% DACs had transmitted the data periodically. The
    most striking feature was the variable patient load across the centers. On an average, each participating center
    reported catering to few new patients. In other words, while there is a dearth of treatment services in the country,
    existing services in the government hospitals are attracting very few patients.Go to:EVALUATION AND MONITORING OF
    SERVICESWhile there is no ongoing program of monitoring the functioning of DACs, on a few occasions, monitoring and
    evaluation exercises have been carried out by DDAP, MoHFW through NDDTC. In the first instance (2002), information
    was obtained from 104 DACs through postal questionnaire and/or through onsite visits. It was seen that most
    hospitals with DACs were providing some treatment services although only few DACs were functioning optimally.
    Subsequently, DACs in five states (Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Nagaland, Manipur, and Maharashtra) were visited in
    2006–07 and interactions with officer-in-charge of the DACs were held. Some of the constraints in the functioning of
    DACs noted in these evaluation exercises included:
    There was mostly no provision of funding for providing services through the state governments for the DACs (except
    for northeastern states that were receiving recurring grant from the central government)Low priority was accorded to
    drug dependence treatment services by the hospital authorities. Trained doctors were not available in many of the
    centers, neither was there any dedicated support staff (nurses/counselors)Very few patients were accessing services
    and even those accessing services were not retained in treatment. Record maintenance was inadequate. Most of the
    medicines required for treatment were usually not available. Psychosocial interventions were often not provided.
    Community-based activities were lacking.</p>

    Subsequently, in one more evaluation conducted in 2007 that focused on assessment of outcome of treatment at the
    DACs, outcome data for 3 years were collected through postal questionnaires and through visits from a total of 44
    centers that had seen more than 100 new patients in the previous year. This exercise also confirmed the findings of
    the previous evaluations.Thus, these evaluation exercises demonstrated that the model of service delivery – based on
    an inpatient setting of care with infrastructure support by the central government and which was dependent on state
    government support for continuation of services – was met with only partial success. Hence, there was an urgent need
    of strengthening the DDAP of MoHFW in India.Go to:STRENGTHENING THE DRUG DE-ADDICTION PROGRAMME IN INDIAThe
    provision of treatment services through DDAP has focused heavily on inpatient treatment services. However, with
    accumulating experience in India and globally, it is now understood that a large number of patients can be treated
    on an outpatient basis and only some may require inpatient services. Based on this, a scheme was developed by NDDTC,
    AIIMS, titled “Strengthening DDAP: Establishment of Drug Treatment Clinics (DTCs)”. The scheme was subsequently
    approved by the Expenditure Finance Committee of the MoHFW for the 12th 5-year plan period (2012-17). Through this
    initiative, it was proposed that the DTC should be made functional in government health-care facilities (i.e.,
    medical colleges and civil hospitals/district hospitals), largely utilizing the existing infrastructure. The DTC
    would be part of the general hospital and dedicated to provide outpatient services for patients with substance use
    problems. Some patients who need admission would be hospitalized in the established DAC ward/psychiatry
    ward/medicine ward. Apart from emphasis on outpatient treatment, the most important departure from the existing
    system includes direct funding from the central government for the staff salaries and procurement of medications
    (routed through NDDTC, AIIMS). A nodal officer identified from the hospital and three dedicated contractual staff
    (doctor, nurse, and counselor recruited for this purpose) are responsible for provision of services. The treatment
    services include psychosocial as well as pharmacological interventions. All the DTCs provide free-of-cost medication
    for short-term treatment of withdrawals and long-term pharmacotherapy (including opioid agonists, opioid
    antagonists, and anti-craving and deterrent medications for treatment of alcohol use disorder). Those patients
    requiring ancillary services are referred to other departments of the hospital and to NGOs for social needs. DTCs
    also follow uniform system of record keeping of key activities and services, with periodic reporting to the regional
    resource centers established in select psychiatry departments of medical colleges. The entire system is based on
    intensive capacity building, monitoring, and mentoring of the staff, coordinated by the NDDTC and other regional
    resource centers. As on December 2016, 14 such DTCs are functional in government hospitals in Delhi, Haryana,
    Maharashtra, Manipur, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The scheme is on a scale-up mode and it is proposed that
    by the end of 2017, there will be 25–30 DTCs across the country. The learning from this phase will be used to expand
    the network of DTCs so that there are at least 100 government hospitals providing free-of-cost, outpatient treatment
    for SUDs across the country. The initial experiences with the scheme are highly encouraging. This initiative has
    been awarded the prestigious British Medical Journal South Asia Award for the year 2016 under the category
    “Noncommunicable Disease Initiative of the Year.”</p>
